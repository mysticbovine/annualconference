# Speaker Bio images

## Minimum: 250px X 250px
Must be square in order to get the round shape. If the image are not perfectly square the CSS will make an oval.
They can be larger, but it's just a waste as the image will only get rendered 250px x 250px

## Code
```html
 <div class="img-circle center-block grow">
    <span class="field-content">
        <img alt="Speaker Name" class="img-responsive" height="200"
            src="images/speakers/speakername.jpg" typeof="Image" width="200">
    </span>
</div>
```

## Hints
JPEG works best for photos.
